            A <span class="bold_1">website</span> (also written as a <span class="bold_1">web site</span>) is one or
            more <span class="bold_2">web pages</span> and related content that is <br> identified by a
            common <span class="bold_2">domain name</span> and published on at least one <span class="bold_2">web server</span>. Websites are <br> typically dedicated to a
            particular topic or purpose,
            such as news, education, commerce,<br> entertainment, or <span class="bold_2">social media. Hyperlinking</span> between web pages gu
            ides the navigation of the <br> site, which often starts with a <span class="bold_2">home page</span>. The <span class="bold_2">most-visited</span> sites are
            <span class="bold_2">Google</span>, <span class="bold_2"></span>Youtube</span>, and <br> <span class="bold_2">Facebook</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="text2">
            All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span class="bold_2">World Wide Web</span>. There are also <br> private
            websites that can only be accessed on a <span class="bold_2">private network</span>, such as a company's internal <br>
            website for its employees. <span class="bold_2">Users</span> can access websites on a range of devices, including <br>
            <span class="bold_2">desktops</span>, <span class="bold_2">laptops</span>, <span class="bold_2">tablets</span>, and <span class="bold_2">smartphones</span>. 
            The <span class="bold_2">app</span> used on these devices is called a <span class="bold_2">web <br> browser</span>.
